# Sudoku
My attempt at creating a fully functional Sudoku game, Currently a work in progress.
At the moment the program will create a 9x9 sudoku grid and will indicated what values could possably go in each square.
The user can position his mouse over a square and use the numbers on the keyboard to enter a value in that square.
The spacebar can be used to automatically begin to fill the board, will fill the board the majority of the time, if it does not, then z key can be pressed 
to undo the moves and try again. The r key can also be used to reset the board.

Update October 3 2022
Added a feature that will solve the board using a brute force backtracking algorithm by making use of the game history that I had previously made.
